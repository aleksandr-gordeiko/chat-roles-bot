## Chat Roles Bot

A bot to manage roles in your Telegram group chat!

---
## Usage

Add `@chatrolesbot` to your group chat to get access to the following
commands:

#### join
&nbsp;Send `/join sample_role` to join `sample_role`.\
You can also just write `/join` and select an existing role with
inline buttons.

#### leave
&nbsp;Send `/leave sample_role` to leave `sample_role`.\
As same as for `join`, you can just write `/leave` and use inline
buttons.

#### ping

&nbsp;To mention (ping) users having a specific role, use the following
syntax:\
`/ping sample_role your_message`, where `your_message` is any text
message you want to provide along with mentioning.

&nbsp;**However, the much more convenient way** is this:\
`@@sample_role`\
&nbsp;Yep, that simple.
