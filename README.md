## Chat Roles Bot

A bot to manage roles in your Telegram group chat!

---
## Usage

Add `@chatrolesbot` to your group chat to get access to the following
commands:

> `/join sample_role`

Send `/join sample_role` to join `sample_role`.\
You can also just write `/join` and select an existing role with
inline buttons.

> `/leave sample_role`

Leave `sample_role`.\
As same as for `join`, you can just write `/leave` and use inline
buttons.

> `/ping sample_role your_message`

Ping (mention) `sample_role`.\
`your_message` is any text message you want to provide along
with mentioning.

**However, the much more convenient way** to ping is this:\
`//sample_role your_message`\
Yep, that simple.
